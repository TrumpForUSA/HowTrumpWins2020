# Trump Parental Leave
Additional bonus ***TUI*** income for parents from three months before to six months after birth.


## Overview
An enhancement to ***TUI***, providing bonus ***TUI*** income for a period of six months after the birth (or adoption) of a child, and three months before the birth of a child, in an amount equal to the average monthly bonus ***TUI*** income for the previous 12 month period.

Both parents are eligible to receive ***TPL*** funds, while single parents will be eligible for an extended period of twelve months after the birth of a child.


## Why?
While ***Trump Child Care*** ensures children at all life stages experience rewarding educational and recreational experienced, ***Trump Parental Leave*** ensures that parents receive the funds necessary to settle in with their new child, and adapt to their new family situation in life.

While some parents may continue working right up until birth - others may have to take an extended leave of absence. ***TPL*** helps ensure all parents remain financially stable as they add a child to their family.


## Eligibility

### Two Parents - Pregnancy
Once the pregnant woman's due date has been established, both listed parents (married couples or the parents that plan to be listed on the birth certificate) will each be eligible to begin receiving ***TPL*** income three months before the due date, which will continue until six months after the due date.

### Expected Single Parents - Pregnancy
For those that plan on being a single parent (either one parent on the birth certificate, or a second parent that doesn't plan on being involved in raising the child), ***TPL*** eligibility will begin six months before the due date, which will continue until twelve months after the due date.

> In all cases, the pregnant mother will make the decision on the eligibility of a parent.

### Adoptions
For those adopting children under the age of 18, ***TPL*** eligibility will begin once the adoption has been finalized for a period of six months, or for a period of twelve months in the case of a single parent.

### USA Adoption Exchange
Mothers with an unwanted pregnancy that have decided to utilize the ***USA Adoption Exchange***, instead of aborting their baby in the first or second trimester, will be eligible to receive ***TPL*** income six months before the due date, which will continue until six months after the due date.

### Multiples
While parents of multiples will receive a separate ***TCC*** account for each child - ***TPL*** benefits will remain the same.


## How It's Delivered
***TPL*** funds will be included as an additional bonus to regular ***TUI*** income.


## Examples
A married couple living in a community with below average educational opportunities and slightly higher crime, with the mother earning an average of $35,000 a year and the father earning an average of $30,000 a year - would be eligible to begin receiving ***TPL*** benefits at three months before the due date of the child, and continuing until six months after the due date (for a total of nine months of eligibility).

The amount of ***TPL*** funds received during this nine month period would be equal to the bonus ***TUI*** funds received based on the average of the previous 12 months.

With a previous 12-month average salary of $35,000, the mother's *Rewarding Employment Bonus* would be $1,333 per month. The father's would be $1,188. Additionally, the couple would each receive $320 a month from the *Equalizing The American Dream Bonus*.

Therefore, in addition to all ***TUI*** income and bonus normally received during this nine month period, ***Trump Parental Leave*** will provide additional bonus funds in the amount of $1,653 to the mother and $1,508 to the father.

Combined, their total ***TPL*** benefit after nine months would equal $28,449, ensuring their family remains financially healthy and stable.
