# Trump Parental Leave
Additional bonus TUI income for parents from two months before to three months after birth.


## Overview
An enhancement to ***TUI***, providing bonus ***TUI*** income for a period of three months after the birth (or adoption) of a child, and two months before the birth of a child, in an amount equal to the average monthly bonus employment income for the previous 12 month period.

Both parents are eligible to receive ***TPL*** funds, while single parents will be eligible for an extended period of six months after the birth of a child.


## Why?
Raising children is a rewarding experience - but one that can take a serious toll when balance work / family life. ***TCC*** ensures that every child has an abundance of educational and recreational activities throughout their childhood, regardless of their parent's financial ability to pay.




## Eligibility
All US Citizens under 18 years old are eligible for ***TCC***, and will receive $500 per month in their ***TCC*** accounts, which their parents and/or legal guardians will have access to.


## Taxes
***TCC*** funds are exempt from all taxes at all levels, including local, state and federal.

## How It's Delivered
***TCC*** funds will be made available to through a specially created ***TCC*** account at any FDIC or NCUA insured institution.

Americans may choose their preferred financial institutions to receive their children's monthly ***TCC*** funds. These are not traditional "cash" accounts - instead a debit card will be the sole means of spending. Financial institutions will not be allowed to charge any monthly or service fees on these accounts.


## Spending Restrictions
* ***TCC*** funds may only be spent at US-based merchants, for specific activities that benefit the recipient child, including educational and recreational activities. Examples include child care, child sports, child learning programs, etc.
* ***TCC*** funds may not be given or gifted to others - and must be spent for the benefit of the recipient child.
* ***TCC*** funds may only accumulate for a period of three years. Funds not spent within three years of deposit will be forfeited to a charitable organization selected at account creation.
* All ***TCC*** funds must be spent by the eligible child's 18th birthday. These funds are not designed to be used for college or other adult learning opportunities.
