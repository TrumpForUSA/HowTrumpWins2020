# Trump Universal Care
Expands and enhances Medicare coverage for all US Citizens, including dental and vision benefits.


## Overview
A *replacement* nationwide health insurance system that expands on the current Medicare system, while providing increased services and coverage - guaranteed to those under 18 and over 65 years of age, including prescription drugs, dental care, eye care, and preventative care services such as nutrition and exercise.

Additionally, ***TUC*** waves most deductibles and copays that are currently part of the Medicare system.

For those aged 18 to 64, ***Trump Universal Care*** is available for a fixed fee depending on age, and will provide the same coverage benefits. However, children turning 18 will receive five years worth of ***TUC*** coverage free of charge, to be used anytime until 65. Each year of earned income, in excess of $20,000, provides an additional two years of TUC coverage free of charge.

Americans that achieve 21 years of earned income in excess of $20,000 will receive ***TUC*** benefits for life, free of charge.


## Why?
Because a healthy America is a powerful America. Healthcare should not be tied to individual jobs - it should be universal and portable - something that you are born with and live with for your entire life.

It's as simple as that.

Being "healthy" is not just about medical care - which is why ***TUC*** will cover dental, vision, prescription drugs and preventative care services such as nutrition and exercise programs - free of most deductibles and copays.


## Eligibility
All US Citizens eligible for Medicare will be eligible for ***TUC***. All US Citizens under 18 years of age will be eligible for ***TUC***, and will receive five free years of ***TUC*** when they turn 18. Those aged 18 to 64 will have to pay a fixed monthly premium to receive ***TUC***, however said premium will be waived for two years for every year employment income exceeds $20,000.


## Medicare Advantage
Medicare Advantage plans will no longer be necessary, as ***TUC*** will provide greater benefits at no cost.


## Medicaid
Medicaid will no longer be necessary - as even those without income aged 18 to 64 will qualify for five free years of ***TUC***, and then may cover additional premiums directly from ***TUI*** funds.
