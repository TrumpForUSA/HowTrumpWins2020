# How Trump Wins 2020
A political platform that will not only guarantee a victory for President Trump (and Republicans) in November - but a win for all Americans for generations to come.

## Introduction
Our country and our world has recently changed. This project was started in April to collaboratively create a winning political platform for President Trump (and the Republicans) in 2020.

President Trump should immediately adopt this platform, so that he, and the rest of the Republicans on the ballots in November, may fully implement this platform beginning in early 2021. Doing this for the good of the American people - Republicans will become the singular political force for decades to come.

## Why?
Because President Trump is in a unique (once in a lifetime) position to lead the Republican Party - his followers, will follow HIM - as will the Republican party. No politician in the history of our country has had a chance like this - a chance to heal our nation, to reshape the United States of America - for the benefit of ALL her citizens. If anybody can get this done... It is President Trump.

Implementing this platform in 2021 will heal our country and cement Trump's legacy for decades to come.

President Trump can - and will - bring together the left and the right, the young and the old, for the good of all Americans, by simply adopting this plan; this great vision for the future of America.
