# How Trump Wins 2020
A political platform that will not only guarantee a victory for President Trump (and Republicans) in November - but a win for all Americans for generations to come.

## Introduction
Our country and our world has recently changed. This project was started in April to collaboratively create a winning political platform for President Trump (and the Republicans) in 2020.

President Trump should immediately adopt this platform, so that he, and the rest of the Republicans on the ballots in November, may fully implement this platform beginning in early 2021. Doing this for the good of the American people - Republicans will become the singular political force for decades to come.

## Why?
Because President Trump is in a unique (once in a lifetime) position to lead the Republican Party - his followers, will follow HIM - as will the Republican party. No politician in the history of our country has had a chance like this - a chance to heal our nation, to reshape the United States of America - for the benefit of ALL her citizens. If anybody can get this done... It is President Trump.

Implementing this platform in 2021 will heal our country and cement Trump's legacy for decades to come.

President Trump can - and will - bring together the left and the right, the young and the old, for the good of all Americans, by simply adopting this plan; this great vision for the future of America.

## Platform Highlights: Economy

### *Trump Universal Income*
A universal basic income that ensures no Americans have to live in poverty, while rewarding those that work hard and advance in their careers with bonus income.

> ***Trump Universal Income*** is protected from creditors, and ranges from $1,000 to $4,500 per month, per citizen - and does not disrupt or replace Social Security (or other federal government programs).

### *Equalizing The American Dream Bonus*
Bonus ***Trump Universal Income*** for citizens who reside in historically "economically challenged zones", including areas with above average crime, below average education scores and/or below average median household income.

> Based on residential zip code (among other factors), citizens will be eligible for up to $500 a month bonus income through ***TUI***.

### *Trump Family Protection*
An extension to ***TUI***, providing life insurance coverage to your named beneficiaries in an amount equal to a historical average of total ***TUI*** payments.

> In the event of an unimaginable tragedy, families (or other named beneficiaries) will receive a payout from TUI to ensure their needs are met, and help compensate them for their loss.


## Platform Highlights: Education

### *Trump Education Loans*
A government backed student loan program that offers deferred payments, zero interest and full loan forgiveness after earning income in highly in-demand careers (like healthcare), as well as "critical infrastructure" and "essential service" careers, for a period of 10 years.

> ***Trump Education Loans*** will allow, for example, those wanting to become doctors to obtain loans to pay for tuition and expenses - while repayments (and interest) are deferred until the completion of the education program. Then, while employed in the learned career - repayments (and interest) will continue to be deferred. After 10 years of employment in the learned career - the entire loan will be forgiven, allowing many Americans, for example, to become doctors for $0.
