# Trump Universal Income
Creditor-protected universal income for all US Citizens, starting at $1,000 and maxing out at $4,500 per month.


## Overview
A universal basic income that ensures no Americans have to live in poverty, while rewarding those that work hard and advance in their careers with bonus income.

Trump Universal Income is protected from creditors, and ranges from $1,000 to $4,500 per month, per citizen - and does not disrupt or replace Social Security (or other federal government programs).


## Why?
Americans are tired of corporate (and local government) bailouts. They do not create value for the majority of Americans, and do little to help drive and increase real GDP. Individuals and small businesses are frequently left out, as demonstrated by the latest $2+ trillion spent in response to the Coronavirus pandemic.

These "top down" bailouts are un-American and harmful to free markets. The government should not be picking winners and losers - instead the free market should decide.

***TUI*** will eliminate poverty, while driving our economy and country forward. Instead of corporate bailouts locked behind boards of directors, Americans themselves will drive economic growth and continually optimize the free market.


## Eligibility
All US Citizens at least 18 years old are eligible for ***TUI***, and will receive $1,000 per month. Limited restrictions may be put in place for those who are incarcerated, found guilty of certain felonies or otherwise have violated program rules.


## Equalizing The American Dream Bonus
Bonus ***TUI*** for Americans who reside in historically "economically challenged zones", including areas with above average crime, below average education scores and/or below average median household income.

Based on residential zip code (among other factors), Americans will be eligible for up to $500 a month bonus income through ***TUI***.


## Rewarding Employment Bonus
Bonus Trump Universal Income for Americans who are employed (including independent contractors), with an additional bonus based on a sliding scale up to the first $100,000 a year of earned income. Employment bonus is available to those aged 13 and above.

| Yearly Earned Income | Bonus TUI | Maximum Bonus
| --- | --- | --- |
| $0 - $25,000 | 50% of earned income | + $12,500 |
| $25,001 - $50,000 | 40% of earned income | + $10,000 |
| $50,001 - $75,000 | 30% of earned income | + $7,500 |
| $75,001 - $100,000 | 20% of earned income | + $5,000 |


## Taxes
***TUI*** funds are exempt from all taxes at all levels, including local, state and federal.


## How It's Delivered
***TUI*** funds will be made available to every US Citizen, through a specially created ***TUI*** account at any FDIC or NCUA insured institution. Each citizen will be entitled to open up to three ***TUI*** accounts, with their monthly ***TUI*** funds split between these accounts.

Americans may choose their preferred financial institutions to receive their monthly ***TUI*** funds. These accounts are fully creditor protected, and are not traditional "cash" accounts - instead a debit card will be the sole means of spending. Financial institutions will not be allowed to charge any monthly or service fees on these accounts.


## Spending Restrictions
* ***TUI*** funds may only be spent at US-based merchants, for goods and services delivered in the United States.
* ***TUI*** funds may not be utilized to obtain cash or gift cards, and may not be used if the ultimate destination of the income is outside the United States.
* ***TUI*** funds may not be given or gifted to others - unless the transaction is done at a US-based merchant when purchasing actual goods and services.
* ***TUI*** funds may only accumulate for a period of six months. Funds not spent within six months of deposit will be forfeited to a charitable organization selected at account creation.
* There will be no restrictions on the types of good or services purchased at US-based merchants. Funds may be used for rent, mortgage payments, loan payments - or for any other goods or services where the merchant is willing to accept payment via debit card, subject to the general restrictions above.
