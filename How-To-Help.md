# How To Help
**Together we can WIN 2020 for THE PEOPLE!**

Welcome to our collaborative project, hosted at GitHub, to create and have President Trump and the GOP adopt this winning platform for 2020 - so that THE PEOPLE win.

While ambitious, if everything goes to plan President Trump will be signing all of our platform policies into law by February, 2021!
